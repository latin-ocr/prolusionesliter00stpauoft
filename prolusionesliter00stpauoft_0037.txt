Hushed be the song3—the Scythian bards no more
Their Odin’s deeds proclaim from shore to shore3
No Pagans worship where the temple stood,

No human victims bathe the shrine with blood ;
But see, from out the ruins slowly rise
A holier fabrio, pointing to the skies ;⁵
On whose pure shrine is once for ever laid
The Paschal Lamb—the one oblation made.
No carrion trophies taint the summer air,
No shrieks of human victims linger there 3
But the erush'd spirit, and the contrite heart,
Like bruised flowem, a. fragrant balm impart,

' Whose holy incense mounting to the skies‚
A God of Righteousness will not despise 3
While hymns of triumph, borne on angel's wing,
Through heaven’s blue vault sweet hallelujahs ring.

O pure Religioni since thy reign began,

Thy Gospel covenant 'twixt God and man,
Dark Superstition‚ and her hellish brood
Have fied, and steep the land no more with blood;
But peace on earth, and mercy to mankind,
Shed their sost influence o’er the human 11111111;
Hope whispers peace, dispels each anxious fear,
Leads to the Cross, and wipes away the tear3
While Faith triumphant, pointing to the skies,
Bids the poor sinner heavenward list his eyes.
Faith in the Saviour is the staff and rod,
Which guides him through the shadowy vale to God ;
Till the freed soul, companion of the blest,
Dwells in sure havens of eternal rest.
