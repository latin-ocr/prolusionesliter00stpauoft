In worthy numbers, for a lyre so dull,
Serimner‚⁹ and the never-cloying feast,
With which his huge immortal frame is full;
Such growing food did eret the rav'nous benet,
With beak impurpled, tear from Tityon's mangled breast·

Therefore shall softer strains awhile my Muse
Engage, and easier tales of gentle Love,
Such tales as once might old Anacreon choose3
That so her infant whispers she may prove,
Ere yet to higher themes her numbers moves
E’en thus, with flutt'rings weak, and passing slow,
Rises from earth the meek-eyed timorous dove3
But when she ’gins her proper path to know,
She εοεαε th' empyreal height, and spums¹⁰ the depths below.

They err who dare deny, that Love <loth dwell
Among those happy spirits, and would deem
With lust of war alone their boscms sweu,
While every other joy doth worthless seem.
Oh, 'tis a vain, an unsubstantial dream}
For art not thou, great Friga, ever there?
Would it not then, sweet lady, ill beseem,
That war should flourish under Odin’s care,
While Love and Peace lie hid, nor thy sweet radianoe share?

Yes‚ there is Love: for damselsn dwell there, sair,
Amid that dark-haired, sun-imbrowned band,

As Venus' swam, and stately as they rem·

Their crescent necks of snow, what time the land
