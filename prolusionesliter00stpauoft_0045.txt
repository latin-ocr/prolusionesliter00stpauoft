But deep in N iflheim's dreary eaverns hid,
The scornful “ Hela²⁴ o’er his bed shall hang,'' »
Mock at his sorrow, and his gruans deride;

Δ His bleeding' bredst shall rend with ruthless fang,
And bid her willing slaves prolong his every paug.

²⁴ Quaen of Niflheim, correspolzding· to Deam-Nm Antiq. The Edda ;

and Southey’ae Deam os Odin.

Wumm Omnem-omna VALEN’rmn.
