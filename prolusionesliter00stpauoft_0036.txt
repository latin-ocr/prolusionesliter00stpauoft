Meanwhile the minstrel smites the Runic lyre,
Tells of their deeds, and fills the soul with fire;
While all, with hymns‚ their votive homage bring
To him, their warrior, idol god, and king.
They sing, how erst his conquering flag, unfurled,
Waved its red pinions o'er the northern world:
How dared he Rome’s victorious Chief withstand,
And left, in free-born pride, his native land.⁴
Changed is the strain ;—the bard, with prescierit eye,
Reads the dark visione of futurity.
He sees proud Rome's imperial city fall 3
The Scythian legions erown the vanquished wall;
The iae-bound poi-tals of the North have poured
The plagues of God, the famine, and 'the sword.
And now he sings, how dying Odin stands,
The fatal steel close grasped in both his hands3
N ine times the thirsting sword laves in his blood3
N ine mortal wounds well forth the purple flood;
The listening chiefs hang on his faultering tangue,
And Eeho shouts their wild, unearthly song:
“ Far, o’er the northern sky's impurpled arch,
Our soul unoonquered wends its airy march ;
See where Valhalla's virgin spirits speed,
To brighter soenes the warrior dead to lead.”

And now, his worth, admiring Goths to praise,
By Upsal’s towers, the Pagan temple raise3
With gold, by pirate hands unholy made,
The Sea-kings' spoils are on the altar laid.
A solemn feast is held one year in nine;
Nine mangled victims fall before the shrine;
Nine mangled dead, beneath the aecursed trees,
Blaneh in the sun, and quiver to the breeze.
