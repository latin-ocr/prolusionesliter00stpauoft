THE HALL OF ODIN.

Qm‘r, warlike Odin, quit thy shield awhile,¹
Nor longer heed the thrilling trumpet's jar,
Let soster notes of joy thy beart beguile,
Not sole responsive to the hurtling war.
Thrice mighty king of men! without thy care
Arte, or of war, or penae? may never shine3
Let then thy looks, so bright and debonair‚
Be shed benignant on my feebler eyne,
“ To grace so mean a song, this lowly lay of mine?

And thou, too, Queen of Beauty and of (ἔωσε,
Friga,⁸ be thou my Muse3 upon thy Lord
The seul-subduing influent-,e of thy fane
Rain down3 and while upon thy ev’ry word
He hange expectant, bid him sheathe his swerd.
Else haply, sor ’tis humbler, mote my lay,
’Mid fieroer din of battle, pass unheard:
Still, is but thou, his Queem thy hidding say,
Then he, by Love enthralled, must needs that voice obey.
