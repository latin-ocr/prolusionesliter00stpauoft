And angry, seem each other to defy:
Each eager warrior shakee his airy lance,
And filis the plain with ehoutae for victory:
But, ha'rk! the olm-ion signals the Advmoe,
And then with knightly host is filled the plain’s expanso.

The shoek of arma resoundz, and far around
Is heard the martial emh: the list’ning phin,
Affrighted, trembles at the horrid sound,
And staggers ’neath the weight of oountless elain.
Bright gleam the falehions of the shadowy min,
As, wheeling round, they curb their steeds’ career,
And badge the welt’ring earth with bloody stain ;·
Red Battle rides abroad on iron ear,

And joyous guides the fate of the yet doubtful war.

WVhen eve, on healiug wings, returns again,
An unseen hand each gaping wound relieves‚¹³
And brings a soothing balm for every pain·
A power divine their inmost wish peroeivee,
And naught that breeds‘ ‘unlovely trouble’‘ leaves.
With life restored, the shield· roofed halle prolong
The notes of mirth again, while Music weavea
Her subtlest charnas around the jovial throng,
And pours anew the sweets‚ which grace the minstrel s song.

Thus hath it been, since odiu, stung with Lovo,
From this his humbler earthly kingdom¹⁴ fied,
And rushed with eager joy to realms above,

To meet his much—loved Queen: his blood he shed

¹³ Before returning to tho evoning moal, their wounds m hesled in ι min-

cnlous manner

¹⁴ Odin's kingdom, while on earth, wa called ΑΒΜ.
