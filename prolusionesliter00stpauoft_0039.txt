And yet my theme doth well deserve his ear,
And eke a loftier, prouder lyre than mine,
So that 1, “all too mean,'’ may scarcely dare
Such noble tales in wilful verse enshrine;
Therefore 1 would that thou inspire my line
With note harmonious 3—win for me the ayd
Of thine own vanquished Odin‚ and confine⁴
In thy victorious arms his might allay’d,
That so, “ Ο dearest Dread‚'' I may not be dismay’d.

The wight‚ 1 wis, on honey-dew⁵ should seed,
And drink th’ inspiring nectar of the skies,

Who could describe Valhalla's contest dread,

And heroes' life renewed in wondrous wise3

Sing how its shield-roof'd halle on pillars rise

Of purest gold, great Friga’s precious tears 3⁶

Or how the gates of that vast edifice‚

Outnumb’ring those Egyptian Thebes uprearS‚⁷
Seek, with aspiring tops, “ to emulate the spheres.'’ .

How hard the task to paint those goblets strange,
To tell how mead, drawn from the foeman's skull,⁸
May quench at once the thirstings of revenge,
And Nature's meaner drought :—hard to eXtol

the fountain of Pastime is called Honey-dcw.—Edda. The fountain Mimis

goddess Friga is addressed in the Edam-Nora». Antiq. p. 190. And we find
a Scandinavian poet calling gold “the tem-s os Frigm'’—Specimem quunic
Poetry. Compare the beautiful legend of the Heliades shedding tem of

shores probably of the Baitia-Herod. iii. c. 115.

enemy.
