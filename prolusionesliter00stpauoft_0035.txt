27

No balmy incense fills the breathing dawn,

No heaven-shed dews baptize the infant mox-113
But virgin Innocenee, sweet holy maid,

And white-robed Peaee in purity arrayed,

Like orphan sistere, wander through the gloom,
To seek in holier lands their distant. home 3
And srighted Nature, weeping at the sight,
Draws o’er her face the sable pall of night.

But harkl what cry of anguish from afar,
What shrieks unearthly rend the midnight air?
And seel what roek its crested might uprears,
And towering o’er the wilderness appears?
What steel-elad forms on phantom coursers fly,
What noise of battle hurtles in the sky?

Lo, where yon cliff its storm-rift sides displays‚
And walls embattled quench the midnight blaze3
There where the yawning ehasm its jaws distends,
What mingled din of mirth and woe ascends?
Deep in a eave, unblest by heavenly beam,
Laved by oblivion’s mute untroubled stream,
Girt in by beetling rocks, more horrid made

By the dark yew, and funeral eypress shade,
Dread Odin dwells, on airy throne reclined‚

In unsubstantial majesty enshrined.

A thousand lamps gleam through the festive hall,

· A thousand banners deck the caverned wall ;

A thousand spectre ehiefs, whose feet have trod
The battle field, surround the warrior god.

The charnel-house their hellish feast supplies3
Their bowls, the reeking skulls of enemies3

The viands stand, with mead and nectar crowned,
The tethered war-horse paws the flinty ground3
The grisly heroes, in that dreamy cell,

Quaff potent draughts of luscious hydromel.
