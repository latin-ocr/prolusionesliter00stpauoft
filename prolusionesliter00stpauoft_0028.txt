And slowly answer’d Arthur from the barge:

‘⁶ The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
And God sulfils himself in many ways,

Lest one good oustom should corrupt the world.
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?

Ι have lived my life, and that which I have done
May He within himself make purel but thou,

If thou shouldst never see my face again,

Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice
Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

For what are men better than sheep or goats

That nourish a blind life within the brain,

If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer

Both for themselves and those who eall them friend?
For so the whole round earth is every way

Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

But now farewell. Ι am going a long'way

With these thou seest—if indeed I go—

(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)

To the island-valley of Avilion3

Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,

Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
Deep-meadow'd‚ happy, fair with orchard-lawns
And bowery hollows crown’d with summer sea,
Where Ι will heaJ me of my grievous wound.”

So said he, and the bargo with oar and sail
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan
That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, '
Ruffies her pure oold plume, and takes the flood
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
Revolving many memorie& till the hull
Look’d ono black dot against the verge of dawn,
And on the meer the wailing died away.
