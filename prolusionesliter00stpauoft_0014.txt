ΤΗΕοΡΗ. ¹Derided too! dispateh, 1 say.

Don. Thou fool!
That gloriest in having power to ravish
A trifle from me Ι am weary of.
What is this life to me? not worth a thought3
Or, if it be esteem’d, 'tis that I lose it
To win a better: even thy malice serves
To me but as a ladder to mount up
To such a height of happiness, where 1 shall
Look down with seorn on thee, and on the world3
Where, circled with true pleasures, placed above
The reaeh of death or time, ’twill be my gl'oty
To think at what an easy price 1 bought it.
There’s a perpetual spring, perpetual youth:
No joint-benumbing oold, or seorohing heat,
Famine, nor age, have any being there.
Forget, for shame, your Tempe; bury in
Oblivion your feign’d Hesperian orehards :—
The golden fruit, kept by the watchful dragon,
Which did require a Hercules to get it,
Compared with what grows in all plenty there,
Deserves not to be named. The Power I serve,
Laughs at your happy Araby, οι· the

Elysian shades 3 for he bath made his bowers
Better in deed, than you ean fancy yours.
