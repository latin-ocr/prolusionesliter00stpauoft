Albeit vain to get their feu desire,

Nor sing of that new world which fite shall mise,

What time the ancient fabric shall expire;

Cease, oease at onee thy too presump‘t‘uous lays, .
And let expressive Silenoe show how vast their praise?

Thriee happy then who in the battle's strife,²¹
Amid the grisly oonfliot’s barbed shower,
Pours forth the bloody current of his life:
The foeman’s sword may drip its dews of gore,
The bellowing darts around him thickly pour,-
And bite the polished helmets in their rago:
But he lies tranquil ’mid the battle‘s roar,
For hopes of heaven do all his thoughts engage,
And though Death’s night dei-hang, his bitter pains assuage.

“ We fought with swords‚” the dying hero sings;
“ We fought with swords, and gave our foes for food
To wolves ; we ba'de the eagles spread their wings
To share the ample meal‚ while to the flood
Of gore swift flew the raven‘s sacred brood.
With joy I oease, for now around me move
The virgins, ‘ who will all my foes delude‚'
And bear me, dying, to the courts above,
To gain the warrior's meed of happiness and love.'’²²

Oh! other far that wretched mortal's fate,

Who lived a eoward‚ and a ooward died ;

No joys like these his dastard soul await,

No²³ guardian maid his heavenward steps to guide3
