Then murmur’d Arthur, ‘⁸ Plane me in the burge?
And to the berge they came. There those three Queens
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and περὶ.
But she, that rose the tallest of them all
And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,

And loosed the shatter’d casque, and chased his hands,
And call’d him by his name, complaining loud,

And dropping bitter tem against his brow

Striped with dark blood: for au his face wne white
And colourless, and like the wither’d moon

Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east3

And all hie greaves and euisses dash'd with drops

Of oneet3 and the light and lustrous curle—

That made his forehead like a rising eun

High from the diffie-throne—were parch’d with dust ;
Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,

Mix’d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
So like a ehatter'd eolumn lay the King;

Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,

From spur to plume a star of tournament,

Shot thro' the lists at Camebt, and charged

Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.

Then loudly cried the bold Sir Beffivere,

“ Ah! my Lord Arthur‚ whither shall I go?
VVhere shall 1 hide my forehead and my eyes?
For now I see the true old times are dead,
When every morning brought a noble chance,
And every chance brought out a noble knight.
Such times have been not since the light that led
The holy Elders with the gist os myrrh.

But now the whole noum> ’mnne is dissolved
Which was an image of the mighty world3
And Ι, the last, go forth companionlese,

And the days darken round me, and the years,
Among new men, strange faces, other minds.”
