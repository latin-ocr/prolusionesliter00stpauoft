Of Cyprus left, to Paphos’ Isle they tend,
With their bright load, and ever as they move,
Owning her genial sway, they gently bend,
And twine their neeks in spiral folds of love3
Thus ’neath Valhalla‘s domes the bright Valkyres rove.

But eease, my Muse, to touch so soft a string;

Let thy great theme more lofty thoughts inspiro,

Some stirring influence o'er thy numbers fling,

And wake to ecstasy thy slumbering fire.

Nor fear that she whom erst thou didst desire

To ayd thy drooping pinion, did not hear,

Nor Odin will refuse to swell thy lyre

With notes of combat loud, and fierce, and dream
Lo! he is at thy side, and bids thee banish fear.

Soon then, as jolly Moru, in venture dight
Of orient beams, “ peeps blushing” on the baud,
The boist'rous revel, and the soft delight
Of wreathed smiles, no more are near at hand ε
But cares of battle every beart command,¹²
And all their soul to ehivalry they yield:
Odiu himself, the monareh of the land,
With ardour glows, that on the listed field
He first against the foe his trusty sword shall wield.

Forth from the swarming gates, in long array,
All bright with armour and embroidery,

The shadowy armies stream: their banners gay,
Blazoned with quaint device, insult the sky,

¹² The mornings of the heroes ef Valhalla are spent in the battle, as the
evenings in the revel and the song.
