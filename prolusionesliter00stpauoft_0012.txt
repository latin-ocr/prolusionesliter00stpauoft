THEOPHILUS. ANTONINUS. DOROTHEA.

Tazora. Now, proud contemnet
Of ue, and of our gods, tremble to think
It is not in the Power thou serv’st to save thee.
Not all the riehes of the sea, increased
By violent shipwrecks, nor the unsearoh’d mines,
(Mammon’s unknown exehequer,) shall redeem thee:
And, therefore, having first with horror weigh'd
What ’tis to die, and to die young3 to part with
All pleasures and delights3 lastly, to go
WVhere all antipathies to comfort dwell,
Furies behind, about thee, and before thee3
And, to add to afflietion, the remembranee -
Of the Elysiun joys thou might’st have tasted,
Hadst thou not tum’d apostate to those gods
That so reward their servants3 let despair
Prevent the hangman’s sword, and on this seaffold
Make thy first entrance into hell.

Amon. She smiles,
Unmoved, by Mars! as if she were assured
Deam, looking on her eonstaney, would forget
Tho use of his inevitable hand.
