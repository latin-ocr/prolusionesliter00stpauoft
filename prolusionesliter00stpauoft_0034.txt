THE HALL OF ODIN.

Smm‘r of Fiction, ere the soul had power
To fill the vaeanee of life’s dreary hour,
What charm was thine, the wanderer’s steps to guide,
Ox· waft with dreams his galley o’er the tide!
Through darkling 'waves he seeks the sabled west,
The mystio tree, and gardene of the blest3
Where sea-born zephyre breathe their fragranoe round,
And golden flowers gleam raedianoe from the ground.¹
And hark! what voice, the natione calling forth
From Asia’s plains, shouts onward to the north!
“ On to the north, where down the mountains rolled,
The king of rivers poure his liquid gold;
No seorehing beate, but o‘er the night and day
The lord of twilight¹ sheds a sostened my3
There through the poplar shade, lit from the skies,
Gleams the bright amber from the Heliads· eyes3
And gray-hued olives³ wave their chequered epray,
Stirred by the breeze, to hail the god of day.” ⁷

Far other hope was theirs, by conquest bred,
Whom Soandinavia’e dreary visione led3
No twilight gaudens, bowers of peace and love,
No rustling shades pour music as they move3
